\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

In heavy-ion collisions at ultra-relativistic energies, it is well established that a strongly coupled Quark-Gluon-Plasma~(QGP) is formed~\cite{Adams:2005dq, Adcox:2004mh, Arsene:2004fa, Back:2004je, Schukraft:2011na}.
Recent measurements in high multiplicity \pp, p--A and d--A collisions at different energies have revealed strong flow-like effects even in these small systems~\cite{Abelev:2012sk, Chatrchyan:2013eya, Khachatryan:2010gv, CMS:2012qk, Abelev:2012ola, Aad:2012gla, Aad:2013fja, Chatrchyan:2013nka, Adare:2013esx, Adams:2006nd}.

In a recent letter~\cite{ALICE:2016fzo}, the ALICE Collaboration reported the multiplicity dependent enhancement of strange (\kzero, \lmb and \almb) and multi-strange (\X, \Ix, \Om and \Mo) particle in \pp collisions at \seven. As well as, those results were complemented by the measurement of $\pi^{\pm}$, $\mathrm{K}^{\pm}$, p, \pbar, \kstar and $\phi$ with ALICE~\cite{ALICE:2018pal}.

In a recent study, the ALICE Collaboration has studied baryon-to-meson ratios with a new twist: by studying the ratios in two parts of the events separately -- inside jets and in the event portion perpendicular to a jet cone~\cite{ALICE:2021cvd}. 
%1408.2672
In contrast to the inclusive distribution, the $\lmb/\kzero$ ratio within jets in \pp and \pPb collisions does not exhibit baryon enhancement.
It is plausible that the baryon enhancement may therefore be attributable to the soft (low $Q^{2}$) component of the collision as discussed in~\cite{Cuautle:2014yda}.
This results disfavors the hard-soft recombination models, while it is consistent with a picture in which the value of baryon/meson ratio has two independent mechanisms: i) the expansion of the soft particles of the underlying event within  a common velocity field (radial flow), and ii) the production of particles via hard parton-parton scatterings and the subsequent jet fragmentation.

This comprehensive set of data does allow for a detailed test of production models.

%The origin of these phenomena is debated in~\cite{Shuryak:2013ke, Werner:2013ipa, Bozek:2013ska, Dumitru:2010iy, Schenke:2015aqa, Ma:2014pva, Ortiz:2013yxa}.
%It was also discussed that in small systems, mechanisms like color-reconnection may produce radial flow-like effects.

%The role of strange hadron yields in searching for QGP was pointed out at an early stage~\cite{Rafelski:1982pu}.
%It was subsequently found that in high energy nucleus-nucleus (A--A) collisions at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) the abundances of strange and multi-strange baryons are compatible with those from thermal statistical model calculations~\cite{Andersen:1998vu, NA49:2002fxd, NA57:2004nxc, NA49:2003bok, STAR:2003jis, STAR:2006egk, STAR:2007cqw, ALICE:2013xmt }

%1204.0282v3
%The multi-strange baryons, $\Omega$~(sss) and $\Xi$~(dss), are particularly important in high energy particle and nuclear physics due to their dominant strange quark~(s-quark) content. The initial state colliding projectiles contain no strange valence quark, therefore all particles with non-zero strangeness quantum number are created in the course of the collision.


%1901.07447
The theoretical picture of collective effects in heavy ion collisions is vastly different from the picture known from \pp collisions. Due to the very different geometry of the two system types, interactions in the final state of the collision become dominant in heavy ion collisions, while nearly absent in \pp collisions.
