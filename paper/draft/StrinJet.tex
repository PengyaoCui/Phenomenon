\section{Introduction}

In heavy-ion collisions at ultra-relativistic energies, it is well established that a strongly coupled Quark-Gluon-Plasma~(QGP) is formed~\cite{Adams:2005dq, Adcox:2004mh, Arsene:2004fa, Back:2004je, Schukraft:2011na}.
Recent measurements in high multiplicity \pp, p--A and d--A collisions at different energies have revealed strong flow-like effects even in these small systems~\cite{Abelev:2012sk, Chatrchyan:2013eya, Khachatryan:2010gv, CMS:2012qk, Abelev:2012ola, Aad:2012gla, Aad:2013fja, Chatrchyan:2013nka, Adare:2013esx, Adams:2006nd}.

In a recent letter~\cite{ALICE:2016fzo}, the ALICE Collaboration reported the multiplicity dependent enhancement of strange (\kzero, \lmb and \almb) and multi-strange (\X, \Ix, \Om and \Mo) particle in \pp collisions at \seven. As well as, those results were complemented by the measurement of $\pi^{\pm}$, $\mathrm{K}^{\pm}$, p, \pbar, \kstar and $\phi$ with ALICE~\cite{ALICE:2018pal}.

The origin of these phenomena is debated in~\cite{Shuryak:2013ke, Werner:2013ipa, Bozek:2013ska, Dumitru:2010iy, Schenke:2015aqa, Ma:2014pva, Ortiz:2013yxa}.
%It was also discussed that in small systems, mechanisms like color-reconnection may produce radial flow-like effects.

The role of strange hadron yields in searching for QGP was pointed out at an early stage~\cite{Rafelski:1982pu}.
It was subsequently found that in high energy nucleus-nucleus (A--A) collisions at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) the abundances of strange and multi-strange baryons are compatible with those from thermal statistical model calculations~\cite{Andersen:1998vu, NA49:2002fxd, NA57:2004nxc, NA49:2003bok, STAR:2003jis, STAR:2006egk, STAR:2007cqw, ALICE:2013xmt }

%1204.0282v3
The multi-strange baryons, $\Omega$~(sss) and $\Xi$~(dss), are particularly important in high energy particle and nuclear physics due to their dominant strange quark~(s-quark) content. The initial state colliding projectiles contain no strange valence quark, therefore all particles with non-zero strangeness quantum number are created in the course of the collision.
